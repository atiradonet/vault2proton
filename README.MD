## Introduction

_F-Secure Password Vault_ (also known as _ID Protection_ or formerly _KEY_) is a secure, encrypted password management tool integrated into F-Secure's security suite.

_Proton Pass_ is Proton AG's password manager, built upon the same privacy-first principles as Proton Mail and Proton VPN.

This tool converts a F-Secure Password Vault export file to Proton Pass' CSV format.
